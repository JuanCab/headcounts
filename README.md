# A small scraper to extract course enrollment information

The MinnState system of colleges and universities (ne√© MnSCU) maintains a
searchable listing of course subjects for the current, one past and one future
semester at [https://eservices.minnstate.edu/registration/search/basic.html?ca
mpusid=072](https://eservices.minnstate.edu/registration/search/basic.html?cam
pusid=072).

Detail on individual courses is also available by subject and/or course ID.

This scraper gathers that information for either

+ All courses in a specific term (only available for terms that appear in the
  search form above), or
+ A list of course ID numbers for a specific year/term.

All of the course detail is dumped into a CSV file.
